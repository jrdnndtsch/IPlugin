###Running Cat! 
##Not just quick but easy to boot, this preloader plugin allows your page to load the way it was always meant to: with style!

[DEMO](http://toharhy.github.io/IPlugin/)
	
###Set up
Setting up is no probelm at all with the Running Cat 
preloader  plugin! Start by downloading ["RunnigCat files.
zip"] and copy the js, css, and image files to your 
directory. Make sure that they all reside in your 
RunningCat folder. Following the download, copy the links
below to locate all your files in your directory.

	

'<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js"/script</script>'
'<link rel="stylesheet" href="cat.css" type="text/css">'
'<script src="runningCat.js"</script>'

	 
##Next
Copy and paste the following code in your HTML.
'<div class="preloader"</code>
'<div class="loaderContainer"</div>'
'<div id="run"</div>'
'</div>'
'</div>'
	
##That is all!
How easy was that? Once your files have been added as links to your directory and your HTML code is in place all you have to do is relax and enjoy the rest of your day with the Running Cat plugin!
Please feel free to make this plugin even cooler than it already is. I'd love to see you try. Add a different animal or any effect to spice things up. The possibilities are endless with Running Cat!

All the best,
Tohar
